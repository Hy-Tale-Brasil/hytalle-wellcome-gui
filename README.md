If you want to add a logo to your mod you will need to add it in a special format. You need to place a .png in this path in your pack `Common/UI/Custom/` with the name `Group_Name.png` from your manifest. It will be automatically detected by the mod and it can be any size (Default size is 96x96 but it will strech and compress the whole image to fit in that area)

For example for this mod it would be `Common/UI/Custom/Buuz135_WellcomeGUI.png`
